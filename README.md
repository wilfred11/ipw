### Propensity Score Matching

The "propensity" describes how likely a unit is to have been treated, given its covariate values. 
Suppose for example a simple case where a company builds factories in villages. To naively compare the effects of the factory on village income a simple weighted mean difference between income with and without factory has to be made. This could lead to the conclusion that mean income of a village lowers after building a factory.
